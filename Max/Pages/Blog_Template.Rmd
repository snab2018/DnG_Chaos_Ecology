## What's In This Template
</div>

This template provides us with the basic building blocks necessary to create a single page within our blog. I setup the file this way in order to more easily embed plots from R. In addition, I also implemented a handful of stylistic features I thought made the blog look nicer. For example, the background color for each page is permanently set to be a light tan and I have added a feature that allows us to quickly center text and/or images. As time goes on, we can add more features to this basic template. But for now, let's just remember that it is guiding the overall aesthetic of the blog.
